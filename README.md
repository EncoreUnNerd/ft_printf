# ft_printf 💻

Welcome to my repo of the 42 projet “ft_printf”.

## About the projet ➡️

The project aims to be a “clone” of the stdio “printf” function, which can be used to display a word/phrase/number etc. in the terminal. My implementation isn't perfect and doesn't include bonuses. 

This project is here to allow you to possibly see another approach to the project. But I advise you not to 'git clone' this project and to use it yourself, this project is written with my logic and syntax etc... I therefore strongly recommend that you do this project yourself at 200%, but this project can still be used to help you understand certain notions that may seem unclear to you.
