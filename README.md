# ft_printf 💻

Welcome to my repo of the 42 projet “ft_printf”.

## About the projet ➡️

The project aims to be a “clone” of the stdio “printf” function, which can be used to display a word/phrase/number etc. in the terminal. My implementation isn't perfect and doesn't include bonuses. 

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective on the project, it can also be useful.
